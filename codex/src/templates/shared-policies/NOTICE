# Codex Internal Use Policy – MVP

## 1  Purpose

Codex accelerates onboarding, code generation, and automation across TAGS projects. This policy preserves IP integrity, security, and compliance while empowering developers.

## 2  Scope

Applies to all TAGS employees, contractors, interns, and approved open‑source contributors ("Users") who interact with Codex tooling or its generated artifacts.

## 3  Acceptable Use

1. **Project Boundaries** – Users may generate or modify code **only** for repositories they are assigned to.
2. **Prompt Hygiene** – Do not paste third‑party proprietary code or customer data into prompts.
3. **Rate Limits** – Follow the quota settings enforced by the Codex gateway (default: 20 requests/minute per user).
4. **Attribution** – Generated code must pass peer review and be committed under the author’s Git identity.

## 4  Code Review Requirements

* Every Codex pull‑request must have at least one human reviewer.
* CI pipeline runs `license-guard`, `static-analysis`, and `security-scan` jobs before merge.

## 5  Data Boundaries

* Codex logs prompt + completion pairs for **30 days** under TAGS’ internal retention policy. This window provides a sufficient audit trail to trace build or tooling errors while minimising data exposure. Logs are automatically purged after 30 days.
* Sensitive credentials must be redacted or replaced with placeholders before prompting.

## 6  Automation Limits

High‑risk tasks (e.g., production database migrations, user provisioning) require a secondary approval workflow.

## 7  Enforcement

Violations may result in access suspension, disciplinary action, or termination, per the TAGS Employee Handbook.

## 8  Amendments

This policy is reviewed every six months by Legal & Engineering Leadership. Revisions require approval from the CTO and General Counsel.
