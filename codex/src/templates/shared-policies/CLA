# IP Ownership Checklist

> **Purpose:** Ensure every code contribution to TAGS projects is legally
> owned by TAGS and free of licensing conflicts *before* merge.

---

## 1  Contributor Status

* [ ] Contributor has a signed **Employment/Contractor Agreement** with Work‑Made‑For‑Hire or IP‑Assignment clause.
* [ ] Contributor has accepted the **TAGS CLA** (see CLA.md).
* [ ] AI‑assisted work acknowledged ("All AI output is work made for hire") in contract or CLA.

## 2  Dependency Audit

* [ ] Run `sbom:generate` (CycloneDX/SPDX) → produces `sbom.json`.
* [ ] Scan `sbom.json` for copyleft or patent‑encumbered licences (GPLv3, AGPL, LGPL, SSPL, BUSL, etc.).
* [ ] If any forbidden licence detected → escalate to Legal before PR review.
* [ ] Record approved licences in `/docs/licenses.md`.

## 3  AI‑Generated Code Review

* [ ] Save prompt + completion pair in `.ai-log/` (retained 30 days in CI artefacts).
* [ ] Reviewer confirms code is **original** (no verbatim third‑party snippets under non‑permissive licences).
* [ ] Code passes static analysis + style linters.

## 4  Pull‑Request Gate (mandatory)

* [ ] **license-guard** CI job passes.
* [ ] **cla‑bot** status is green.
* [ ] At least **one human reviewer** approved the PR.
* [ ] Changelog / version header updated where required.

## 5  Escalation Matrix

| Issue found      | Contact                       | Action                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Copyleft licence | `legal@thenagrygamershow.com` | Block merge, seek alternative. |
| Patent concern   | General Counsel               | Perform patent clearance.      |
| Large AI snippet | Eng Lead + Legal              | Perform originality check.     |
