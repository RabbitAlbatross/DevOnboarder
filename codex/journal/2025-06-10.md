# Documentation Tools – Maintenance Automation
<!-- PATCHED v0.1.0 codex/journal/2025-06-10.md — feature rollup summary -->

# Feature Rollup – June 10, 2025

The following updates were consolidated into DevOnboarder:

- Replaced the deprecated branch lint GitHub Action.
- Fixed Makefile indentation using tabs.
- Improved the frontend Docker build to install dependencies correctly.
- Added patch headers to container files and documented patch header usage.
- Ignored `node_modules` in Docker builds.

All subsequent CLI tools and automation steps append logs to this folder
under `codex/journal`.
