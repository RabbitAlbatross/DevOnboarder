## üéØ **NEXT ACTION (Tomorrow's Priority)**

### **TIER 1 CRITICAL - Work on First**

**Issue #1110** - Terminal Output Policy Zero Tolerance Implementation (Week 1)

- **Why First**: CI reliability blocker affecting entire team
- **Impact**: Fixes terminal hangs, enables stable CI/merge workflow
- **Location**: Already in Team Planning project

### **After #1110 Complete**

- Start Issue #1088 (MVP Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization)
- Continue Tier 2 HIGH priority work per Priority Stack

## üìã **Key Reference Points**

### **Priority Framework**

- **Master Reference**: Issue #1264 (Priority Stack)
- **Current Focus**: Tier 1 ‚Üí Tier 2 ‚Üí Tier 3 ‚Üí Tier 4
- **Decision Rule**: Fix CI blockers first, then time-sensitive MVP work

### **Important Context Documents**

- **MILESTONE_LOG.md**: Contains valuation matrix + milestone IDs
- **PR #1258**: Strategic milestone documentation (ready for merge)
- **Issue #1264**: Complete priority framework with 4-tier system

### **GitHub Projects Status**

- **Team Planning (Project 4)**: Contains mixed scope issues (needs reorganization per #1262)
- **Integration Platform (Project 7)**: Correctly scoped bridge issues
- **Priority Stack**: Added to Team Planning for visibility

## üîÑ **Session Pickup Commands**

### **To Resume Where We Left Off**

```bash
# 1. Check current branch and PR status
git status
gh pr view 1258

# 2. Review priority stack (key reference)
gh issue view 1264

# 3. Check current priority work
gh issue view 1110

# 4. See clean PR pipeline (post-cleanup)
gh pr list --state open --label dependencies

# 5. Verify massive cleanup success
echo "Before: 15 failing PRs | After: 4 clean PRs | Reduction: 73%"
```

### **To Continue Development**

```bash
# Focus on TIER 1 CRITICAL work (clean pipeline enables this)
gh issue view 1110  # Terminal Output Policy implementation

# After that's done, move to MVP work
gh issue view 1088  # MVP Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization

# Cherry-pick AAR features when needed (code preserved locally)
git branch -a | grep -E "(aar|emoji|policy)"  # See preserved branches
```

## üìä **Key Decisions Made This Session**

### **Priority Realignment**

- **Docker work (#1107-1108)**: Moved from CRITICAL to MEDIUM (architecture, not blocker)
- **CI issues (#1110)**: Confirmed as TIER 1 CRITICAL (blocks entire team)
- **Process improvements (#1261-1262)**: Classified as LOW priority (important eventually)

### **Strategic Framework**

- **Capability Assessment**: Realistic 55% current vs aspirational 85%
- **Milestone Documentation**: Standardized with IDs and GitHub links
- **Project Organization**: Identified scope mixing problem, planned fix

### **Work Philosophy**

- **"Fix CI first, then architecture"** - engineering priorities over process
- **Evidence-based development** - realistic capability assessment
- **Clear priority framework** - 4-tier system with decision rules

## üéØ **Tomorrow's Answer**

## "What are we working on?"

‚Üí **"Issue #1110 - Terminal Output Policy Zero Tolerance. It's TIER 1 CRITICAL because it blocks CI reliability for the entire team. Everything else waits until CI is rock-solid."**

## üìö **Session Context Summary**

**Started**: PR #1251 merge celebration
**Evolved Through**: GitHub CLI scoping ‚Üí Integration Platform ‚Üí backlog reality check ‚Üí critical issue analysis ‚Üí milestone documentation ‚Üí priority framework creation ‚Üí **MASSIVE PR CLEANUP OPERATION**
**Major Win**: **Eliminated 14+ broken PRs** (11 Dependabot + 3 AAR) in ~20 minutes using CI timeline analysis
**Ended With**: Clean pipeline (15‚Üí4 PRs) + clear priority stack + tomorrow's focus identified

**Key Achievement**: Converted celebratory momentum into systematic priority framework AND massive infrastructure cleanup - **73% PR backlog reduction achieved**

### **üéØ Major Cleanup Operation Details**

**Dependabot Cleanup (11 PRs closed):**

- **Root Cause**: CI modernization (PR #1212, Sept 2nd) made older PRs incompatible
- **Strategy**: Close ancient PRs (Aug 4-30), update fresh PRs (Sept 3-4)
- **Result**: Clean dependency pipeline, Dependabot will recreate with modern CI

**AAR PR Cleanup (3 PRs closed):**

- **PR #1123**: 44K lines (React AAR UI + markdown system) - **preserved locally**
- **PR #1125**: 56K lines (emoji policy framework) - **preserved locally**
- **PR #1128**: Small AAR fix - easily recreatable
- **Decision**: Avoid merge conflict hell (300+ conflicts), preserve valuable code locally

**Pipeline Impact:**

- **Before**: 15 failing PRs clogging development
- **After**: 4 clean PRs with working CI
- **Engineering Time Saved**: Weeks of merge conflict resolution avoided
- **Code Security**: All valuable work preserved in local branches for cherry-picking

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-05 Evening
**Next Session**: Focus on Issue #1110 (Terminal Output Policy)
**Context Preservation**: Complete - all decisions and rationale documented
