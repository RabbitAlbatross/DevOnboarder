# Architecture Overview

This document illustrates how the platform connects GitHub, Discord, and
DevContainers to streamline onboarding.

## Workflow

1. Developers clone the repository or open it in GitHub Codespaces.
2. The DevContainer sets up required tools and installs pre-commit hooks.
3. Changes are pushed to GitHub where Actions run tests and linting.
4. Build results and challenge statuses are posted by the Discord bot.

These steps ensure consistent environments and real-time feedback during
contributor onboarding.
