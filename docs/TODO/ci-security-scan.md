# Documentation Tools – Maintenance Automation
<!-- PATCHED v0.1.30 docs/TODO/ci-security-scan.md — CI scan notes -->

# CI Security Scan TODO

This document collects notes for automating security scans in CI.

## Goals

- Trigger dependency and code scans on every pull request.
- Upload results to the security dashboard.
- Fail the build on high severity vulnerabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` with the existing runners.
2. Require the `SNYK_TOKEN` secret for Snyk scans.
3. Collect reports under `security/reports/` for auditing.
