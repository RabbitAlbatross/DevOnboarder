# Documentation Tools – Maintenance Automation
# TAGS Founder's Mission Module (Sidebar Draft)

## Purpose

This module serves as a personal mission dashboard for the founder (Reesey275 / Mr. Potato), integrated within the TAGS platform. It anchors the platform's purpose to the founder's journey, values, and long-term goals, reinforcing accountability, alignment, and impact.

## Module Name (Working Title)

`/mission` or `PotatoOps` — internal module for founder's self-tracking, strategy, and alignment.

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Mission Dashboard

* Summary of long-term vision
* Why statement
* Core values
* Visual progress tracker of mission-based goals

### 2. Builder's Tracker

* Task breakdown by phase (education, platform, outreach, leadership)
* Role-based goals: developer, founder, mentor
* Logs of wins, blocks, and pivots

### 3. Daily/Weekly Reflection System

* Daily check-ins
* Weekly summaries
* Guided prompts ("Did I act in alignment with my mission today?")

### 4. Journal Module

* Personal notes (markdown + voice memo support)
* Tags for sorting (e.g., mindset, technical, leadership)
* Private by default, role-based optional sharing

### 5. System Integrations (Phase 2)

* GitHub, VSCode extension
* Git commits linked to milestones
* Discord bot hooks (for motivational logging or daily quotes)

## Benefits

* Reduces fragmentation between mission and action
* Keeps founder aligned with TAGS as a purpose-driven ecosystem
* Provides a structure for future founder/leader onboarding
* Can be forked as an open-source personal mission template for other builders

## Notes

This document will evolve as the feature matures. All features should maintain modularity for easy isolation, toggling, or export to future spin-off apps.
