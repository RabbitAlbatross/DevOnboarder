# Documentation Tools – Maintenance Automation
# Project Structure and Development Plan

This document outlines the directory structure and development plan for the project, focusing on clarity, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## **Directory Structure**

### **1. Frontend**

- **Purpose**: Contains the website's frontend code, built using React for the user interface.
- **Key Features**:
  - User-facing components.
  - Integration with the `auth` service for authentication.

---

### **2. Auth**

- **Purpose**: Handles authentication using Discord OAuth.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Discord OAuth login flow.
  - Token generation and validation.
  - Redirecting users after successful authentication.
- **Note**: Avoid adding user management or roles/permissions logic here unless absolutely necessary.

---

### **3. Users**

- **Purpose**: Reserved for extending user functionality (if needed).
- **When to Use**:
  - If additional user metadata, custom profiles, or preferences need to be stored.
- **Current Status**: May not be necessary if Discord OAuth fully manages user data.

---

### **4. Roles/Permissions**

- **Purpose**: Reserved for custom roles and permissions outside of Discord's scope.
- **When to Use**:
  - If Discord's roles/permissions are insufficient for the project's needs.
- **Current Status**: May not be necessary if Discord's capabilities are sufficient.

---

### **5. API1 and API2**

- **Purpose**: Reserved for future APIs.
- **Examples**:
  - `api1`: Analytics API.
  - `api2`: Content Management API.
- **Current Status**: Empty but documented for future use.

---

### **6. Infrastructure**

- **Purpose**: Centralizes infrastructure-related files.
- **Contents**:
  - `docker-compose.prod.yml`
  - `traefik.yml`
  - Deployment scripts (e.g., Kubernetes manifests, Terraform files).
- **Goal**: Keep the root directory clean and organized.

---

### **7. Shared**

- **Purpose**: Contains shared utilities, libraries, or components used across multiple services.
- **Examples**:
  - Utility functions (e.g., logging, error handling).
  - Shared libraries (e.g., custom Discord API wrapper).
  - Reusable components (e.g., middleware).

---

### **8. Docs**

- **Purpose**: Documentation for the project.
- **Contents**:
  - Setup guides.
  - API specifications.
  - Architecture diagrams.

---

## **Development Plan**

### **1. Finalize the Auth Service**

- Ensure it handles Discord OAuth and nothing else.

### **2. Evaluate the Users and Roles/Permissions Directories**

- Decide whether these directories are necessary.
- Remove them if Discord OAuth fully manages users and roles.

### **3. Integrate Frontend with Auth**

- Set up the login flow and token handling.

### **4. Prepare the Infrastructure Folder**

- Add all necessary configuration files (e.g., Docker, Traefik).

### **5. Document Future APIs**

- Leave `api1` and `api2` empty but document their intended purpose.

## High-level project overview

   This project is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy addition of new features and services.

   The directory structure is organized to separate concerns and promote maintainability.

---

## **Flexibility**

- Regularly review and adjust the structure as the project evolves.
- Revisit the roles/permissions setup or reorganize directories if new features require significant shared functionality.

---

By following this structure and plan, the project will remain clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.
