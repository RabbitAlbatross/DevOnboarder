# TAGS: Secrets Security Policy
<!-- PATCHED v0.2.9 docs/internal/TAGS-Secrets-Security-Policy.md â€” Use .env.development -->

---

## Purpose

Ensure all environment variables and sensitive credentials are securely handled, versioned, and isolated across environments using modern secret management practices.

---

## Guidelines

### File Naming & Structure

* Use `.env.development`, `.env.prod`, `.env.test` for environment separation
* Maintain `.env.example` with safe placeholders only
* Never commit real secrets to version control

### Docker & Secret Management

* Use `secrets/` directory with Docker volume mounts for services needing runtime credentials
* Where applicable, utilize Docker Swarm secrets or host-level mounts for isolated container access
* Use centralized `secrets/` mount point on TrueNAS or production host when applicable

### CI/CD Integration

* Validate required environment keys at build time using CI workflows
* Compare `.env` to `.env.example` to detect missing or extraneous variables
* Disallow deployment if required secrets are missing or undefined

### Git Safety

* Add `.env*` and `secrets/` to `.gitignore`
* Do not allow PRs with `.env`, `config.js`, or other secret-containing files

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integrate external secret managers (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
* Add secret rotation policy with alerts
* Define permission levels for secret access by environment

---

**Usage:** This policy governs all TAGS infrastructure, bots, apps, and deployment containers.
