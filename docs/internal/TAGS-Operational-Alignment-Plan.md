# TAGS: Operational Alignment Plan

---

## Objective

Establish a consistent, repeatable, and hardened development workflow for all TAGS projects that ensures maximum reliability, security, and maintainability. This will serve as the foundation for monetization.

---

## 🔁 Development Workflow Standardization

### Source Control

* All changes go through pull requests (PRs) with semantic commit messages.
* Branch naming convention: `feature/<module>`, `bugfix/<module>`, `hotfix/<module>`
* PRs must link to Azure DevOps or GitHub work items.

### File Versioning

* Patch headers in each file (e.g., `v1.0.2`) updated per change
* Each PR includes a change log entry

### Git Standards

* Commit: max 79 characters per line
* Use semantic commit messages in the `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` format
  (see `docs/Git/Git.md`)
* Document structure and standards saved in `Git.md`

### PR Template

📄 Refer to: [TAGS: PR Template](./TAGS-PR-Template.md)
Version: v1.0.0 — Last updated: 26 May 2025 17:48 (EST)

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage & CI Integration

### Testing

* Unit tests required for all utility functions and business logic
* Integration tests for major workflows (auth, role assignment, session handling)
* Frontend: Vitest | Backend: Jest / Supertest | Python: Pytest

### Shared Test Utilities Module

📄 Refer to: [TAGS: Shared Test Utilities](./TAGS-Shared-Test-Utilities.md)
Version: v1.0.0 — Last updated: 26 May 2025 17:49 (EST)

### Continuous Integration

* GitHub Actions / Azure Pipelines trigger on PR
* Lint + Test + Build required before merge

---

## 🛠️ Error Tracking & Telemetry

### Logging

* Use structured logs in backend (Winston / Pino)
* Frontend logs sent to Sentry

### Monitoring

* Implement Sentry on frontend + backend
* Prometheus/Grafana for infra
* Add PostHog for user behavior analytics (optional per project)

---

## ⚙️ Automation Hooks

### Assistant-Aided Tasks

* Auto-generate:

  * Release notes from PRs
  * Updated `.env.example` from active `.env` file
  * Patch version bumps in file headers

### Documentation Anchors

* Use `Comment Anchors` in VSCode for all TODOs
* Flag all PATCH entries for inclusion in `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## 📘 Documentation & Indexing

### Canvas Naming Convention

* Prefix: `TAGS:`
* Format: `TAGS: <Project or Module Name>`

## ✅ Immediate Next Steps

* [x] Generate PR template with all checks
* [x] Create shared test utilities module for each project
* [x] Harden `.env` and Docker secrets workflows
* [x] Formalize `CHANGELOG.md` structure
* [x] Begin version tagging Canvas documents
* [x] Create `.vscode-integrations` documentation module

## 🔜 Annotated Tasks for Later Execution (In Priority Order)

1. [ ] Define VSCode extension recommendations (`extensions.json`)
2. [ ] Standardize launch/debug configurations for frontend, backend, and Docker (`launch.json`)
3. [ ] Document onboarding process for new developers (linked to Operational Plan)
4. [ ] Define `lint-staged` and `husky` pre-commit hooks for frontend/backend projects
5. [ ] Create onboarding README for test suite usage and expectations
6. [ ] Generate PostHog instrumentation template (optional)
7. [ ] Build infrastructure monitoring doc (Prometheus + Grafana setup)
8. [ ] Integrate `.env.example` validators into CI pipeline
9. [ ] Define final format for monetization-ready documentation bundles

## 🧭 Final Word

This isn’t just a roadmap — it’s your **competitive advantage**. Once operational alignment is complete, monetization becomes a matter of polish and positioning.

Let’s keep the pressure high and the bar higher.
