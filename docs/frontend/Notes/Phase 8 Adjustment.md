# Documentation Tools â€“ Maintenance Automation
âœ… Deferred and noted for Phase 8. Iâ€™ll pass this on to the frontend:

### ðŸ“£ Frontend Team Note â€“ Phase 8 Adjustment

The backend has implemented the `/api/auth/user` route to support session rehydration using the decoded JWT payload (`req.user`). When you begin Phase 8, please:

- Update the session logic to **call `/api/auth/user`** during app boot or refresh
- Replace reliance on `localStorage.user` with fresh data from the server
- Ensure `auth_token` is still stored locally to authenticate the refresh request

This will help keep user roles, verification status, and permissions in sync with Discord changes.

Let me know when youâ€™re ready to scope out Phase 8 and weâ€™ll prepare the full plan.
