# Documentation Tools – Maintenance Automation
# 📘 Teaching Aid: Math Process Playbook

> **Purpose:** This playbook is designed to provide a clear, repeatable framework for solving real-world algebra problems using logic, structure, and repeatable systems thinking. It will evolve alongside your mastery and serve as a teaching tool for others.

---

## 🔁 Core Philosophy

> **“If it can’t be clearly explained, it can’t be consistently repeated.”**

Every problem we solve should:

* Have a **defined input and expected output**
* Follow a **structured, step-by-step approach**
* Be **repeatable and teachable** to others
* Reinforce logical decision-making

---

## 📐 Universal 5-Step Problem-Solving Model

### 1. **Read for Structure — Not Just Numbers**

* Ask: What is the story problem *really* about?
* Highlight key info: values, times, totals, and rates.

### 2. **Identify Input and Output (X and Y)**

* What is being controlled or changing (independent variable `x`)?
* What is being measured or resulting (dependent variable `y`)?

### 3. **Define Two Key Points**

* Convert word problems into coordinate points: `(x₁, y₁)` and `(x₂, y₂)`
* Translate time (if relevant) into simple numbers (e.g., 1 PM = 13)

### 4. **Apply the Slope Formula**

$$
\text{slope (rate)} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} 
$$

* Label units (e.g., shirts/hour, gallons/minute)
* Be consistent with point order (x₁ with y₁, x₂ with y₂)

### 5. **Write the Equation (Optional but Powerful)**

* General form: $y = mx + b$
* Use a known point and the slope to solve for `b`
* Express the full function for reuse, modeling, or graphing

## 🧰 Tools for Translating Real-World Problems

| Real-World Clue | Algebraic Meaning       | Resulting Format         |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| "By \[time]..." | A specific value of `x` | Point (x, y)             |
| "Increased by"  | Change in `y` (rise)    | Use in slope numerator   |
| "Over \[time]"  | Change in `x` (run)     | Use in slope denominator |
| "Per hour/day"  | Implies slope (rate)    | `m` in `y = mx + b`      |

## 🧮 Functional Comparison Shortcut: Estimating Growth from Data

> When comparing two functions to determine which one grows faster, and exact derivatives or rates are not provided, use slope estimation over a common interval.

### How to Apply:

1. Pick two small `t` values (like 2 and 4) and plug them into both functions.
2. Record the outputs: `f(2)` and `f(4)` for each.
3. Use the slope formula:
   $\text{Average Rate} = \frac{f(4) - f(2)}{4 - 2}$
4. The function with the **larger average rate of change** over that interval grows faster.

### Why It Works:

* Works for **logistic**, **exponential**, and other nonlinear functions.
* Compares **growth behavior over time** — ideal when graph or function form is known.
* Management or policy-based questions often imply slower growth is preferable (e.g. less debt).

### Caution:

* Use the **same interval** for both functions.
* This estimates **overall behavior**, not instantaneous rate.

## 🔎 Interpreting Ordered Pairs on Graphs

When given a point $(x, y)$ on a function like $W(m)$, always interpret it as:

> “At time $x$, the function value is $y$”

For example, if $W(m)$ is the **amount of water in a tank**, and you see:

> $(160, 9200)$, it means: “At 160 minutes, there are 9,200 gallons **remaining** in the tank.”

### Caution:

Do **not** assume that $y$ represents the **amount removed or changed** unless the function itself defines it that way.

Always read the **axis labels** and function descriptions before inferring meaning.

## 🔄 Rates of Change: Tangent vs. Secant Lines

### 🔹 Tangent Line:

A **tangent line** is a straight line that touches a curve at **exactly one point** and represents the **instantaneous rate of change** at that point. It tells you how fast the function is changing *at that very moment*.

> Think of the tangent line as the function's slope at a single instant in time.

### 🔹 Secant Line:

A **secant line** intersects a curve at **two points** and represents the **average rate of change** between those points. It gives you a big-picture view of how the function is changing over an interval.

> Use a secant when you want to know the change over time, not just at a moment.
