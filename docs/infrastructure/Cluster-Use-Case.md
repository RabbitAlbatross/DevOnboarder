# TAGS Studios ‚Äì Infrastructure Deployment Blueprint

## üìå Purpose

This blueprint provides a scalable and secure infrastructure model for **all divisions under TAGS Studios**, including centralized services and project-specific resource allocation. Project Aurora (AI-driven game platform) is included as a specialized module with GPU-intensive compute requirements.

* [ ] Generator backup for Tier 3/Tier 4 redundancy
* [ ] Dual UPS systems (N+1 or 2N configuration preferred)

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Cooling Requirements

* [ ] Liquid cooling infrastructure or compatibility
* [ ] Chilled water or direct-to-chip cooling system
* [ ] Redundant HVAC systems with independent zoning
* [ ] Environmental sensors for temperature and humidity
* [ ] Raised flooring or hot/cold aisle containment

### üîê Security & Compliance

* [ ] Controlled physical access (badge, biometric, or PIN)
* [ ] Server room surveillance and monitoring
* [ ] Fire suppression system (non-destructive gas type preferred)
* [ ] Rack-level locking and access logging
* [ ] Compliance: NIST, ISO 27001, or FedRAMP (optional)

### üì° Networking & Connectivity

* [ ] 100G uplink or distributed 10G/40G switching
* [ ] Dual-homed internet or private fiber connections
* [ ] Isolated VLAN for AI compute traffic
* [ ] Remote KVM or IPMI access provisioning
* [ ] DNS, DHCP, NTP, and IPAM readiness
