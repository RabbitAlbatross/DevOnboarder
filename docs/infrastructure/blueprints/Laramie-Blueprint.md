# Project Laramie Blueprint

## 📌 Purpose

**Project Laramie** delivers a lightweight service mesh for experimental game
features.
This blueprint details a serverless-first deployment model leveraging managed
cloud services.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

* **Runtime**: AWS Lambda functions with API Gateway
* **State**: DynamoDB tables per microservice
* **Logging**: CloudWatch with OpenTelemetry sidecars
* **Deployment**: Terraform modules via GitHub Actions

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. Configure Terraform state backend in S3.
2. Bootstrap API Gateway endpoints for each Lambda service.
3. Apply least-privilege IAM roles for execution.
4. Integrate observability stacks through OpenTelemetry exporters.
