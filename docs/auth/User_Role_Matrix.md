# Documentation Tools ‚Äì Maintenance Automation

This document outlines the **user role structure** used across the Discord Auth Backend, Frontend Session Handling, and Moderation Tools. It defines how different roles impact permissions and identity classification.

## ‚úÖ Authorization Flow Summary

1. **User logs in via Discord OAuth**
2. Backend fetches user + member roles from admin server
3. Roles are checked to determine:
   - `isAdmin` ‚Üí based on Owner/Admin/Moderator roles
   - `isVerified` ‚Üí based on basic verification roles
   - `verificationType` ‚Üí based on `VERIFIED_*` identity roles
4. A JWT is issued with all resolved flags
5. Frontend uses `useSession()` to expose these flags for access control

## üß™ Sample User Response (Admin + Military Verified)
```json
{
  "id": "123456789",
  "username": "ChadReesey",
  "email": "reesey@example.com",
  "avatar": "https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/...",
  "isAdmin": true,
  "isVerified": true,
  "verificationType": "military",
  "verificationStatus": "approved",
  "guilds": [
    {
      "id": "1065367728992571444",
      "name": "The Angry Gamer Show Developers",
      "roles": [
        "1358962069369651210",  // OWNER
        "1358961996699009205",  // MILITARY
        "1362162595955609680"   // VERIFIED_MILITARY
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìå Notes
- `verificationType` and `verificationStatus` are **not** tied to admin/mod roles.
- Admins may or may not have identity verification roles.
- Moderators and Admins should still verify separately if required by system policy.
