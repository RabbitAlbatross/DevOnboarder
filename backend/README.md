# Documentation Tools – Maintenance Automation
<!-- PATCHED v0.1.1 backend/README.md — note SQLAlchemy requirement -->

# Backend FastAPI Service

This directory contains the main FastAPI application used for Codex challenge
evaluation and general backend APIs.

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`SQLAlchemy` is already listed in `requirements.txt` for database integration.

## Running the Service

You can start the server directly with Python:

```bash
python backend/main.py
```

or launch it via Uvicorn for automatic reload:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

## Running Tests

Execute the unit tests from the repository root:

```bash
pytest -q
```
