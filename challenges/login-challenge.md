# Documentation Tools – Maintenance Automation
<!-- PATCHED v0.1.28 challenges/login-challenge.md — Login form challenge -->

# Login Form Challenge

Create a minimal login form using HTML and JavaScript. Your solution must:

- Render input fields for **username** and **password**.
- Validate that both fields are not empty before submission.
- Display a success message such as `Logged in` after a valid submission.
- Prevent network requests; the form does not actually authenticate.

Place your code in `submissions/login_solution.py` or an equivalent file when submitting.
